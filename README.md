Use Case: Gaming items, Access Passes, Uniswap V3 Liquidity Positions.

Tech: On-chain SVG, dynamic metadata.

How it works: The contract logic changes the metadata based on external factors. For example, a "Sword NFT" that gets stronger (metadata updates) the more you use it in a game.

Code Context: The "Rentable" and "Dynamic Metadata" examples.
